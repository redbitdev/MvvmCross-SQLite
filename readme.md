##MvvmCross Sqlite-Net

An attempt to allow the community to more easily contribute...

This repository is a fork of the wonderful https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net/

This repository relies on 'core' nuget packages from https://github.com/slodge/mvvmcross

We're looking for contributors and Admins for this project.

Some of the TODOs on the list are:

- add Async - @Praeclarum and @Jarroda have already done the 'hard work' - we just need to work out how to include it - do we switch to Profile78? Do we drop WP7.5? Do we hack in AsyncBridge somehow?
- add Test harnesses - @Praeclarum and team have done this already - we just need to merge back here
- consider extensions - like https://bitbucket.org/twincoders/sqlite-net-extensions
